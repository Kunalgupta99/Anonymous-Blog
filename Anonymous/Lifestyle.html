<p style="font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right:30px;"> <pre></pre> A lifestyle blog is an online platform inspired by a blogger’s daily life, personal interests and areas of expertise, and usually includes content in more than one niche or interest.

    Where some blogs may be defined by their niche – a food blog, for instance – lifestyle blogs are often defined by their variety of topics.
    
    Because of this diversity, they are great niches for parents to get into.
    
    There are more overly complicated definitions, but essentially if you want to cover more than one niche on your blog, there’s a good chance yours would fall into the lifestyle blog category.
    
    If you want to publish recipes but also talk about decorating your home, you’ll likely have a lifestyle blog on your hands.
