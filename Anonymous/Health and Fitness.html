<p style="font-size:20px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right:30px;"> <pre></pre> Fitness blogs have become an essential component for many people who want to train at their own pace, keep their motivation high and overall improve their life.

    In fact, 70% of fitness enthusiasts would rather learn about a workout from someone else, like a gym buddy, than by themselves. Another  finds that 73% of people with new year resolutions give up within 6 months.
    
    The keys to having a successful workout and completing your fitness goals are motivating with someone else, entertaining yourself and enjoying what you do. If you make boring workouts, your fitness plans can quickly lose pace. So make your exercise fun and youâ€™ll stick to it for a very long time.
    
    We have searched the internet and curated what we feel are the top 75 fitness blog resources available right now to inspire, help, train and guide during your training to improve your personal health. They are written by people, for the people.
